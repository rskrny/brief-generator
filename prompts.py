ANALYST_PROMPT = """
You are a world-class video analyst and brand strategist. Your task is to analyze the provided video file and deconstruct its core components.
Your entire output MUST be a valid JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.

The JSON object must have two main keys: "influencerDNA" and "keyMoments".

1.  **influencerDNA**: A comprehensive profile of the creator's style. (Persona, ToneVibe, VerbalStyle, ProductionAesthetic).

2.  **keyMoments**: You are REQUIRED to identify **exactly 4 distinct moments**. You MUST NOT return an empty list.
    * For each moment, you must provide a `timestamp`, a `description`, and a `category`.
    * **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** The 4 moments you select MUST be from different parts of the video (e.g., one from the beginning, two from the middle, one from the end) and show **visibly different actions or compositions**. Do not select multiple timestamps that correspond to the same continuous action. Failure to provide 4 visually distinct moments will result in a poor quality score.
    * **CRITICAL FORMATTING:** The timestamp MUST be in the full "HH:MM:SS.ms" format. For example, 5.5 seconds must be formatted as "00:00:05.500".
    * The `category` must be ONE of: ["Opener", "Product Shot", "User Interaction", "Unique Style", "Call to Action"].
