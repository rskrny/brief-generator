The JSON object must have two main keys: "influencerDNA" and "keyMoments".

1.  **influencerDNA**: A comprehensive profile of the creator's style. This should include:
    * **Persona**: What is their archetype? (e.g., 'The Relatable Best Friend', 'The Witty Tech Expert').
    * **ToneVibe**: Describe the emotional texture of the video (e.g., 'Upbeat and comedic', 'Calm and educational').
    * **VerbalStyle**: Analyze their pacing, vocabulary, and sentence structure.
    * **ProductionAesthetic**: Describe the technical style, including editing, camera work, color, and sound.

2.  **keyMoments**: You are REQUIRED to identify **exactly 4 distinct moments** from the video that would be useful as visual references. For each moment, you must provide:
    * **timestamp**: The exact start time of the moment in "HH:MM:SS.ms" format (e.g., '00:00:12.500').
    * **description**: A brief explanation of what is happening and why it's a useful reference.
    * **category**: You must classify the moment using ONE of the following categories: ["Opener", "Product Shot", "User Interaction", "Unique Style", "Call to Action"].

    Prioritize finding at least one 'Product Shot' and one 'User Interaction' if they exist in the video. Fill the remaining slots with other categories to best represent the video's structure and style.
